# Contacts-Management-System-in-C++
It is basic working of how Contacts system work means it can do all basic task that we use most of the time in Contacts System.

Certainly! A Contacts Management System in C++ is a program designed to manage a list of contacts, typically including information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and any other relevant details. Here's a basic description of how such a system might work:

Firstly I want to tell you that this code is written in C++ using concept of OOP(Object Oriented Programming) also this code is written in 3 File Structur to enhance user experience and understanding about code.

1). Add Contact: Allows users to add a new contact to the contacts book by providing details such as first name, last name, phone number, email, and address.

2). Merge Duplicates: Merges duplicate contacts based on their phone numbers, removing duplicate entries from the contacts list.

3). Store Contacts to File: Saves the list of contacts to a file in a structured format, including details such as first name, last name, phone number, email, and address.

4). Load Contacts from File: Loads contacts from a file into the contacts book, populating the contacts list with the stored contact information.

5). Print Contacts Sorted: Prints the list of contacts sorted based on a specified sorting criterion, such as first name or last name.

6). Search Contacts: Allows users to search for contacts based on various criteria such as first name, last name, phone number, email, or address.

7). Display Count of Contacts: Displays the total number of contacts currently stored in the contacts book.

8). View Details of a Contact: Allows users to view the details of a specific contact by providing its index in the contacts list.

9). Update Details of a Contact: Enables users to update the details of a specific contact, such as first name, last name, phone number, email, or address.

10). Delete a Contact: Allows users to delete a specific contact from the contacts book by providing its index.

11). Create a Group: Enables users to create a new group and add contacts to it for better organization.

12). Add Contact to Group: Allows users to add a specific contact to an existing group in the contacts book.

13). Store Group Info to File: Saves the information about groups and their members to a file for future reference.

14). Remove Contact from a Group: Enables users to remove a specific contact from a group.

15). Contact to View Its Groups: Displays the groups to which a specific contact belongs.

16). Delete a Group: Allows users to delete a specific group from the contacts book.

17). View Search History: Displays the search history, showing the queries made by the user during the current session.

Overall, the provided code implements a comprehensive contacts management system in C++, allowing users to add, update, delete, search, and organize contacts efficiently. It also provides features for managing groups and storing contact information to files for persistence.
